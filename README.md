# Machine Learning (Coursera)

This is my solution to all the programming assignments and quizzes of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code. And for deepening your knowledge, you can follow Stanford CS229: Machine Learning | Autumn 2018 by [stanfordonline](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)
