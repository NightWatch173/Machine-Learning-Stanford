# Machine Learning (Coursera)

This is my approach to all Machine-Learning (Coursera) programming assignments and quizzes taught by Andrew Ng. You'll get a broad idea of machine learning algorithms after completing this course. Try to solve all assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere, feel free to browse the code.
